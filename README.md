# Adventure of Finnigan Fox

## Project Overview
In this project, We will be creating an open world game. The game's core task is to go and defend a village and help build up a defense to help against a raid, then soon you'll plead to the enemy to stop, then you'll learn their true intention, wanting a stick. . . with corn stuck in it. You go and collect more items and build up a stick encrusted with corn and then plead with the stick and keep the village safe.

- **Dialogue system**
